# MD-nets: Medical Domain Adaptive Neural Networks
This is the Pytorch implementation for our paper [Adaptive adversarial neural networks for the analysis of lossy and domain-shifted datasets of medical images](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00733-w), ***Nature Biomedical Engineering***

**TLDR; Adversarial learning can be used to develop high-performing networks trained on unannotated medical images of varying image quality, and to adapt pretrained supervised networks to new domain-shifted datasets.**

### Abstract 
In machine learning for image-based medical diagnostics, supervised convolutional neural networks are typically trained with large and expertly annotated datasets obtained using high-resolution imaging systems. Moreover, the network’s performance can degrade substantially when applied to a dataset with a different distribution. Here, we show that adversarial learning can be used to develop high-performing networks trained on unannotated medical images of varying image quality. Specifically, we used low-quality images acquired using inexpensive portable optical systems to train networks for the evaluation of human embryos, the quantification of human sperm morphology and the diagnosis of malarial infections in the blood, and show that the networks performed well across different data distributions. We also show that adversarial learning can be used with unlabelled data from unseen domain-shifted datasets to adapt pretrained supervised networks to new distributions, even when data from the original distribution are not available. Adaptive adversarial networks may expand the use of validated neural-network models for the evaluation of data collected from multiple imaging systems of varying quality without compromising the knowledge stored in the network.

## Dataset
### Download
.txt files are lists for source and target domains 

The Embryo, Malaria, Sperm  are available online [here]([https://osf.io/dev35/](https://osf.io/3kc2d/)) and Office-31 datasets from [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jhoffman/domainadapt/#datasets_code)  Once they are downloaded and extracted into your data directory, create .TXT files with filepaths and numeric annotation with space delimited.

The data used for training and testing are suggested to be organized as follows:

```bash
DATA_ROOT_DIR/
└── DATA_SET_NAME
    ├── DISTRIBUTION_SET_NAME
            ├── CLASS_NUMBER
            .   ├── file_name.png
            .   └── file_name.png
            .   . 
            ├── CLASS_NUMBER
            .   ├── file_name.png
            .   └── file_name.png
    └── DISTRIBUTION_SET_NAME
            ├── CLASS_NUMBER
            .   ├── file_name.png
            .   └── file_name.png
            .   . 
            ├── CLASS_NUMBER
            .   ├── file_name.png
            .   └── file_name.png
```

### Nomenclature:

|      |   |                                                 |
|------|---|-------------------------------------------------|
|      | D | [ S-Sperm, E-Embryo, M-Malaria/Redblood cells ] |
| DYst | Y | [ M-Model, D-Dataset]                           |
|      | s | [data distribution]                             |
|      | t | [data distribution]                             |


For dataset and imaging system nomenclature, s is graded from 4 through 1, with 4 being the dataset/imaging system of highest quality image (clinical microscope systems) and 1 being the dataset/imaging system of lowest quality (smartphone microscope systems). For example, ED4 denotes the embryo dataset imaged using a clinical Embryoscope that was used by embryologists for the annotations. 

 t is only used when defining domain adaption models, to denote source (s) and target (t) that were used when developing the model. For example, EM41 denotes a model (M) trained on embryo datasets (E) with Embryoscope images (4) as its source and smartphone images (1) as its target.
